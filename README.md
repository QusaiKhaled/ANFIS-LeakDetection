# ANFIS-LeakDetection
Implementation of Artificial Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (ANFIS) models for leak detection in water distribution networks. The repository includes models trained on large-scale leak detection datasets using optimization techniques of gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent, along with preprocessing pipeline for time-series data, feature selection and extracting, and handling class imbalance. Additional machine learning models were used for baseline comparison.

Dataset used is compiled from LeakDB dataset, available at github.com/KIOS-Research/LeakDB; which is a benchmark simulated dataset for leak detection in water distribution networks, created using the Water Network Tool for Re-silience (WNTR).
