# ANFIS-LeakDetection
Implementation of Artificial Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (ANFIS) models for leak detection in water distribution networks. The repository includes models trained on large-scale leak detection datasets with techniques like SGD and MBGD, along with preprocessing for time-series data, feature selection, and handling class imbalance.

Dataset used is the LeakDB dataset (github.com/KIOS-Research/LeakDB); a benchmark simulated dataset for leak detection in water distribution networks, created using the Water Network Tool for Re-silience (WNTR).
